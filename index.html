<h1 class="t">Box office receipts</h1>
<p class="t">The animated film Kung Fu Panda grossed $ 631.7 million worldwide: $215 million in the United States and $416 million in other countries . [4] As of December 2011, the film is the 53rd highest-grossing animated film of all time, the 11th highest- grossing animated film , and the 6th highest-grossing film of 2008. The film is also among the top 10 highest-grossing non-sequel films by DreamWorks Animation to date . [31] It took the top spot in its opening weekend in the United States from 4,114 theaters with $60 million, [32] and was fourth worldwide with $20 million. [33] In its first weekend in Russia, the film took first place with $7 million, [34] and grossed $20 million in total.</p>

<p class="t">The film was also well received in China . [35] It grossed over 110 million Chinese yuan at the box office by July 2, 2008 , becoming the first animated film to gross over 100 million Chinese yuan at the box office . [36] [37] Chinese director Lu Chuan commented, "From a production standpoint, the film is almost perfect. The American creators showed a very sincere attitude toward Chinese culture." [38] [39] With the film's success at the Chinese box office, some Chinese people have questioned the quality of Chinese domestic animation. The fact that such a successful film based on Chinese culture was produced by American film industries has led to some Chinese introspection . [40] [41] [42]</p>

<p class="t">The film's score was written by John Powell and Hans Zimmer . Hans Zimmer visited China to experience its culture and meet with the National China Symphony Orchestra in preparation for his work. Timbaland also assisted Zimmer in creating the soundtrack . [22] Zimmer and Powell last worked together on the films The Road to El Dorado and Chill Factor , also from DreamWorks . The final song, Kung Fu Fighting  , is a modified version of the famous song of the same name . The composition was No. 1 in the US and UK charts in 1974. In the Russian dubbing, the final song, "Kung Fu Masters Are Not Born," is performed by Ilya Lagutenko . The official release of the soundtrack occurred on June 3, 2008, by Interscope Records . [23]</p>
<h1 class="t">Continuation</h1>
    <p class="t">DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg said in an interview that the success of the film exceeded all expectations, and that a series of five or even six films could be created [48] . Moreover, at the end of the second part , the main plot is interrupted, and viewers are shown a Chinese village hidden from prying eyes, in which the main character's father "felt" his baby with his heart and said: "My son is alive!" This is clear evidence that the third part of the cartoon is just around the corner. At the moment, the next film, already in production, is called " Kung Fu Panda 2 ". It was released in Russian cinemas on May 25, 2011. Like all the studio's films released after 2009, the film was shot using 3D technology [49] . In late May 2011, screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger spoke about the possible return of Jean-Claude Van Damme in Kung Fu Panda 3, as well as the possible participation of Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal .</p>
